# Python-learner
Want to learn to code in python
To be honest I don't really know what I'm
doing here, i saw GitHub quite some time ago
and i thought to myself, hey this might be
what i want, i read the tutorial but 
unfortunately I'm too dumb to understand how
these branches and repositories work, if ayone
could explain in greater detail it would be a great help,
even tho what was in the tutorial was quite descriptive
 Well now something about me and why i am trying to write this today
 I'm a 15 years boy in highschool 10th grade
,personally i don't really get well with the other
Adolescents so yeah, i thought about it long and a lot
 And i have come to the conclusion that i really wanna learn
 python so i can program games and my future dream
 job is cyber security but i do not know how to learn or where
 to start, so today I'm here trying to get some answers if y'all are so kind to do so
 Since I'm quite a "captive" child, my parents cut my internet at 10pm and so i wanna 
get a job as fast as i can and live by myself with a friend
 So anyway can y'all teach me how you all do it?
